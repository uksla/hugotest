## Hello

Using Vector Editor is as easy as one, two, three:

1. Pick up a style and drop the required objects onto the stage.
2. Arrange the scene as needed.
3. Export your resulting masterpiece to PNG or SVG.


In this section you will learn all the basic operations that you can do with objects on the stage.
