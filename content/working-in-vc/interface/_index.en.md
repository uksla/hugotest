The interface of Vector Creator features only essential controls, so you donâ€™t have to spend much time learning how to interact with it.

The interface consists of the following main elements.

1. The **left panel**. Use the tabs on the panel to switch between the categories of objects (people, animals, plants, etc.) displayed in the Gallery (2). Also, the **Search** button found at the top of the panel opens the search bar, where you can type your search request. You can search both among all styles or within a certain style.

2. The **Gallery**. Here you will select the required style and browse the objects of the selected style.
3. The **Canvas**. That is your working area.
4. The **Undo** and **Redo** buttons. Use them to cancel or redo your actions. You can also use the **Ctrl+Z** shortcut to undo your actions.
5. The **Menu** button. Unfolds two commands:
    
    * **Create new** - opens a new document.
    * **Duplicate** - creates a copy of the current document.

6. **Canvas settings**. Use these controls to set the canvas orientation and size. You can select one of the preset sizes or define a custom size.
7. **Zoom controls**. Use these controls to zoom the canvas in and out. You can also do with the **Ctrl+ scroll wheel** shortcut.
8. The **Export** button. Opens the export panel, where you can select the required export format or share your art on social media.
9. Your avatar. A click over the avatar opens a menu with the following options:

    * **My vectors** - brings you to a page with all your illustrations. For details, click here.
    * **My account** - brings you to your Icons8 profile.
    * **Log out** - signs you out of the current account.
