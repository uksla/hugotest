You can **group** multiple objects and then move and resize them as a single object. For this, just select the required objects, and click the **Group** button to the right of the bounding box.

There are two ways to select multiple objects:
1. Click-and-drag over the objects. This works fine when the objects you need do not overlap with objects that you do not want to include into the group.
2. Hold down **Ctrl** or **Shift** and click the required objects one by one. A repeated click over an object will deselect it.

To **duplicate** and **delete** objects, use the respective buttons to the right of the bounding box. Alternatively, you can use the standard **Ctrl+ะก > Ctrl+V** shortcuts to duplicate objects, and the **Delete** or **Backspace** key to remove objects from the canvas.
