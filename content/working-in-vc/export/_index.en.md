When you're done with an illustration, you can download or share it on social media.

For download and illustration:
1. In the upper-right corner, cick **Export**. The export panel appears.
2. Click the down arrow next to the required format, to download the illustration. PNGs of up to 800*534 px, which is enough for most cases, are free for a link. Larger images up to 2,400x1,600 px and SVG will require a <a href="https://icons8.com/pricing" target="_blank">subscription</a>.

To share an illustration, copy the link on the export panel or use the social media buttons (see the figure below).
